# Library Management System

A simple Library Management System implemented in C#. This project demonstrates the use of events to notify members when new books arrive at the library.

## Features

- Add new books to the library.
- Notify members when a new book arrives using events.
- Simple console application for demonstration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 6.0 or higher)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   cd library-management-system
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

2. The application will demonstrate adding books and notifying members. You will see output in the console when a new book arrives.

### Example

```csharp
Library library = new Library();
Member member = new Member();

library.OnNewBookArrived += member.OnBookArrived;
library.AddBook("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald");
```

### Event Handling

- The `Library` class has an event `OnNewBookArrived` that is triggered when a new book is added.
- The `Member` class has a method `OnBookArrived` that handles the event and prints the book details to the console.
